                <p style="font-size: 15pt;margin-right: 50px; padding-top: 20px;">Hello my name is LJ and I just wanted to know why traveling costs so much for such a short period of time. <br>
                    I looked it up on google.com and they couldn't really help me. So I started my research and I didn't get any luck. So I kept looking, then I thought to myself I'm not getting my answer because It's a national issue, not just in my mind. <br>
                    <br>
                    I got a bit confused, so for the first one I asked why is the cheapest flight from LA to New York? The lowest being $134 and the highest $344, according to Cheap Flights website: <a href="//au.trip.com/flights/los-angeles-to-new-york/airfares-lax-nyc" style="color: #71C1E8;">//au.trip.com/flights/los-angeles-to-new-york/airfares-lax-nyc</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Is this necessary? In Los Angeles, minimum hourly wage is $15. <br>
                    Can someone who works part-time enjoy the simple luxury of traveling from state to state? <br>
                    They can't! This is expensive and feels unattainable and honestly, disrespectful! <br>
                    Does the flight ensure my safety, food, and the option to rest? Probably not.<br>
                    Can we ever get to a space where we can afford the luxury of travel? April 2nd of 2023 will be my 2nd time traveling by air and I can't help but ask, will I ever be able to do this again?

                        There's plenty to do in LA! Hundreds of parks, free museums, and nice neighborhoods that can help clear your mind. Stepping outside doesn't have to be local either. Maybe you've been saving up and want to go somewhere far, doing something nice for vourselt is never wrong.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Magic Johnson Park- This is probably the largest park near me. The paths and walkways go across a long trail. I recall being chased by geese when I was 7 but it was one of the happiest moments of my life.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            MOCA - One of the prettiest free museums in LA. There's a rav of happiness that comes over me whenever look at art. it's a feeling everyone deserves to experience.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            lieander and Myrrh- This street is the intercept where I used to walk everyday to catch my bus to scholi. Every now and
                            then take a walk around there just to reminisce on what my mornings as a child looked like. Its a bitter sweet reeling out it warms my heart.

                            “Look the part” always crosses my mind. Sometimes when you want to feel good you have to look good. Maybe it's the opposite, you want to feel comfortable, you can always throw on some sweats and a cozy sweater.
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Pajamas- Nothing feels more comforting than dressing cozy yet still looking cute
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Y2K- This style is PERFECT for confidence. Everyone looks good in it and it definitely is a mood booster
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Royalty- Having all eyes on you is always a confidence boost. Occasionally, I wear dresses that look overly dramatic just because I think I look pretty, it always makes my day.

                                Whenever I'm sad, I find myself walking to my local Popeyes and getting myself a chicken sandwich. Although comfort food has a negative stigma attached, there's truly nothing more comforting than good food. I remember when I was young, I'd be waiting for school to end, not because I wanted to go home but because I knew that my mom would be there waiting with a nice hot plate of molé.

                                    Snacks- Happiness is a large big gulp Powerade from 7-eleven. I enjoy eating gummy bears, sour belts, and chips to comfort myself whenever I have a bad day.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Baking- Baking with friends has always been therapeutic. I recently made oatmeal cookies with diced apples and they were ok but the best part was spending time with my friend! :)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Cooking- This is a great way to get in touch with your inner child! Having a fresh meal that you used to eat as a kid warms not only your stomach but your heart as well!
